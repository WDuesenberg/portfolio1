This is my first professional portfolio. I've put quite a bit of thought into it's layout and how I want it to present...ME!

# Overview
The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge as a Full Stack web developer.
Therefore I want to try to use as many different styling features, technologies etc. but also keep it classy and maintain a solid
level of user friendliness.

# Technologies
    HTML
    CSS
    Bootstrap
    JavaScript (Coming Soon)
